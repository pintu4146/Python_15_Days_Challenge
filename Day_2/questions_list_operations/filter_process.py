"""
ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement: Filter and Process a List of Transactions
ðŸ‘‰ You are given a list of transactions (in tuples) containing:

Transaction ID (integer)
User Name (string)
Amount (float)
Status (string: "Success", "Failed", "Pending")
âœ… Your Task:

1. Filter out failed transactions.
2. Sort the successful transactions by amount (ascending).
3. Remove duplicate transactions (same Transaction ID).
4. Extract only the user names of successful transactions into a new list.
âœ… Example Input:

transactions = [
    (101, "Alice", 250.75, "Success"),
    (102, "Bob", 500.00, "Failed"),
    (103, "Charlie", 125.60, "Success"),
    (104, "Alice", 300.50, "Pending"),
    (105, "Bob", 500.00, "Success"),
    (101, "Alice", 250.75, "Success")  # Duplicate transaction
]
âœ… Expected Output:

[
    (103, "Charlie", 125.60, "Success"),
    (101, "Alice", 250.75, "Success"),
    (105, "Bob", 500.00, "Success")
]
["Charlie", "Alice", "Bob"]
