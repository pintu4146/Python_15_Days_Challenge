"""
ðŸŽ¯ Problem: First and Last Occurrence of Target
Given: A sorted array arr and a target value x
Return: The first and last index of x
If not found, return [-1, -1]

ðŸ§  Real-World Examples:
Count frequency in a sorted array

Log search: Find first and last timestamps

Range queries

âœ… Example:
python
Copy
Edit
Input: arr = [5, 7, 7, 8, 8, 10], target = 8
Output: [3, 4]

Input: arr = [5, 7, 7, 8, 8, 10], target = 6
Output: [-1, -1]
ðŸ§© Intuition:
We run two binary searches:

One to find the first occurrence (left bound)

One to find the last occurrence (right bound)

ðŸ”§ Function Signature:
python
Copy

def first_and_last_occurrence(arr: list[int], target: int) -> list[int]:
    pass
