# 📘 Tuple vs List in Python – Interview Revision One-Pager

A quick and interview-ready comparison of `tuple` and `list` in Python with real-world reasoning and use cases.

| Feature           | Tuple                                | List                                | Reason / Interview Insight |
|------------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Mutability**    | ❌ Immutable (can't be changed)       | ✅ Mutable (can change)              | Tuples are safer for **fixed/constant data**. Lists are better for data that needs updates. |
| **Memory**        | ✅ Smaller memory footprint           | ❌ Slightly larger                   | Tuples use less memory due to their fixed-size, making them better for **read-only collections**. |
| **Speed**         | ✅ Faster lookup/iteration            | ❌ Slightly slower                   | Python internally optimizes immutable structures like tuples. |
| **Intent**        | ✅ Signals constant, fixed structure  | ❌ Signals dynamic, modifiable data  | Tuples communicate clear design intent: “This data is not meant to change.” |
| **Hashable**      | ✅ Yes (if elements are hashable)     | ❌ No                                | Tuples can be used as dictionary keys or set elements. Lists cannot. |
| **Use in Sets/Dicts** | ✅ Yes                            | ❌ No                                | Useful for memoization, caching keys, etc. |
| **Function Return** | ✅ Great for fixed multi-value returns | ✅ Used for dynamic returns       | Tuples convey a clear, fixed shape like `(name, age)`. Lists imply variable length. |
| **Best Use Case** | Lookup tables, configs, constants     | Collections to be modified (append, remove) | Use `tuple` to show intention + avoid bugs. Interviewers love clear choices. |

## ✅ Summary:

- ✅ Use **`tuple`** when:
  - The structure is **fixed**
  - You don’t intend to **change** the values
  - You want **faster**, **safer**, and **memory-efficient** lookup

- ✅ Use **`list`** when:
  - You’ll be **adding/removing** elements
  - You’re building or modifying data dynamically

## 🧠 Final Tip:
> “Use `tuple` when your data is like a law.  
> Use `list` when your data is like a todo list.” 🧠
