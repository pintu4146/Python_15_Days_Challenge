ğŸ‘‰ Problem Statement:
Convert a given number of days into years, weeks, and remaining days.

ğŸ“Œ Edge Cases to Handle
âœ… Standard case (e.g., 365 should be 1 year, 0 weeks, 0 days)
âœ… Handling Leap Years? (For simplicity, assume 1 year = 365 days)
âœ… Zero days input (0) should return 0 years, 0 weeks, 0 days
âœ… Negative input (-10) should raise a ValueError
âœ… Large input (10000 days) should be handled correctly
